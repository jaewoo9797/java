A JAVA-based application created as part of my learing journey

This project serves as a sandbox for exploring and applying Java concepts step by step.

As I deppen my understanding of JAVA, I continuosly update the application to reflect my progress and newly acquired skills. 

I appreciate any questions or suggestions for improving the code I've written. Feel free to share your thoughts or propose better approaches at any time. Thank you!
